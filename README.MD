## Hosting Considerations

Hosted on Heroku @ https://polar-cliffs-76536.herokuapp.com and it's free tier, so waking up from sleep takes about 5-7 seconds

## Setup the project for local development

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Running tests two ways!

1) You can run the unit tests by using 
```
npm test
```
This uses jasmine-node for simplicity, so just shows similar to progress plugin from karma -> on the commandline are where the results are

2) Use postman - The postman collection file is in the postman folder. Just: 

      1) Download postman

      2) Click import in the top left of your postman

      3) Drag the file on the space under the first tab option labelled by "Import File"
